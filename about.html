                <h2>What we are</h2>
                <p>Edinburgh Napier Games Technology Group is part of the School of Computing Science research and teaching department. With a core team of researchers, we undertake teaching and development in game technology, such as advanced graphics, physics-based simulation, and interactive sound. The academics, post-doctoral researchers and PhD students who make up the group come from a wide range of academic disciplines, including computer science, mechanical engineering, sociology, education, and design.</p>
                
                <p> Much of our work aims to push the limits of what is possible and develop new innovative solutions. With major research threads include highly parallel execution environments, interactive graphics, and creative technologies. Edinburgh Napier Games Technology Research and Development is designed to enthuse and enable you to pursue a career in the fast expanding computer games industry, a sector that includes both entertainment and educational 'serious games'. 
                    <p>The research and courses at Edinburgh Napier University focus on a range of computer programming techniques that are required to develop and produce high quality game products. The broad study programme covers essential fundamentals of computer science and broader computing fields such as graphics, physics-based animation, and artificial intelligence. At the heart of all our research and teaching, though, is a commitment to quality. </p>
